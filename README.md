**Idea** 

We wanted to create a terminal application that would make use of a public API. The best approach was to create a weather based application that would the set the foundation. Our biggest challenge was to create something challenging but achievable in a two day standard. Our idea was to incorporate API calls from worldweatheronline to search and retrieve various weather conditions around the world and convert this into a user friendly format to be displayed in a front-end layer within the terminal.  

We would design four major functions that would be beneficial for a traveler. Our idea is to set a function that would allow the user to type any city within Australia, allow them to enter GPS coordinates, area codes and airport codes and it would output weather conditions based on those functions the user inputs.
